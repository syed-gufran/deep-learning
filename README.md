# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository! This contains various projects, notebooks, and experiments created to explore and enhance my understanding of deep learning concepts and applications.

## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository includes:

- Jupyter notebooks for different deep learning tasks
- Data preprocessing and training pipelines
- Evaluation and visualization scripts

> **Note:** The trained model files (such as `.h5` files) are **not uploaded** to this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations.

## 📥 Accessing the Model Files

You can still get the trained models in the following ways:

1. **Run the Notebooks**  
   Most notebooks are self-contained — simply run them, and they will train and generate the required models.

2. **Visit My Kaggle Profile**  
   I’ve uploaded the trained model files and additional resources to my Kaggle profile:
